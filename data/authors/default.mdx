I'm currently in my final year, pursuing a major in Computer Science at BITS Pilani - Goa Campus, India. My journey in Dev began in high school, where I first dabbled in PHP and JavaScript. I really enjoy working with technology - taking it apart, figuring out how it works, and then putting it back together better than before.

I am a full-stack developer, with some experience in DevOps (AWS). Currently, I work as a Tech Lead (Web) at Allos.ai, where my responsibilities include overseeing and executing the entire software development process, from initial conception to final delivery. Previously, I have had the opportunity to work with MIT Media Lab, University of New South Wales, and Libero Health.

My research endeavours have spanned the fields of MLOps, Data Visualisation, Cognitive Science, and TinyML. Recently, I explored Infrastructure Drift Detection (Federated Learning) and Task Queues (Celery, Dramatiq, RQ). I am a Google Summer of Code contributor at INCF, working on the LORIS (Longitudinal Online Research and Imaging System) project to enhance open-source neuroinformatics tools for the scientific community.
